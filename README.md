# GetOutBCN

GET OUT is a collaborative database of cool spots in Barcelona that don't appear in the typical guidebooks. It is divided into different categories so you can search. Feel free to create a user profile to add spots to your favorites and even to add spots to the database that you think may be interesting for other users. But above all GET OUT!
